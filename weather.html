    <h1 class="hurr-weather">Hurricanes Will Become Stronger and More Intense</h1>
    <p class="hurr-weather-p">The intensity, frequency and duration of North Atlantic hurricanes, as well as the frequency of the strongest (Category 4 and 5) hurricanes, have all increased since the early 1980s. The relative contributions of human and natural causes to these increases are still uncertain. Hurricane-associated storm intensity and rainfall rates are projected to increase as the climate continues to warm. <em>(Nasa.gov)</em></p>

    <h1 class="prep-weather">Changes in Precipitation Patterns</h1>
    <p class="prep-weather-p">Average U.S. precipitation has increased since 1900, but some areas have had increases greater than the national average, and some areas have had decreases. More winter and spring precipitation is projected for the northern United States, and less for the Southwest, over this century.
Projections of future climate over the U.S. suggest that the recent trend towards increased heavy precipitation events will continue. This trend is projected to occur even in regions where total precipitation is expected to decrease, such as the Southwest.<em>(Nasa.gov)</em></p>
